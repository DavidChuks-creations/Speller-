# Speller-
Implemented a program that spell checks a file using a hash table
Implemented functions in order, load, hash, size, check, and unload all in dictionary.c file as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that TIME IN load, TIME IN check, TIME IN size, and TIME IN unload are all minimized. To be sure, itâ€™s not obvious what it even means to be minimized, inasmuch as these benchmarks will certainly vary as you feed speller different values for dictionary and for text. But therein lies the challenge, if not the fun, of this problem.
